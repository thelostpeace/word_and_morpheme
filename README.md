# Word and Morpheme

This repo means to find the relationship between word and morpheme in linguistics.

In English, words may have stem and affixes, such as `beautiful => beauty`, `grateful => grate`, `reality => real`. In Chinese, `蝴蝶 => 蝴 蝶`, `开心 => 开 心`.
This repo is an experiment on Chinese words and morphemes, ngram words won't be splitted, so `蝴蝶` has it's own embedding and it's meaning is attented on embedding of `蝴` and `蝶`.
So in this example `蝴蝶` is the query and `蝴`, `蝶` are the values.

A classification is done with TextCNN with one model splitting words in morpheme level and the other in word level.
